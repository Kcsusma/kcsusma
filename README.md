Hi, I’m Susma KC – a recent MCA graduate with a passion for data analysis.I’ve completed a comprehensive Data Analyst course at Skillovilla, where I honed my skills in Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, and Statistics. Through hands-on projects like analyzing sales data in Excel, designing airline databases with SQL, and building interactive dashboards in Power BI, I developed a strong foundation in data manipulation, visualization, and reporting. I love turning raw data into meaningful insights and am excited to share my projects and explore new challenges in the world of data.
